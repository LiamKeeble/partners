\frametitle{About me}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Currently in the third year of my PhD
	\item Studying how scientists research cognitive evolution and animal behaviour
	\item From language to language evolution to animal communication to animal cognition
	\end{itemize}

\section{The module}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The module}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item We are going to look at structure in language
	\item And we are going to give you the perspective and tools necessary to approach linguistics problems
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Patterns}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item We will look at every level of language
	\item But at each level there will be one common denominator:
	\item Patterns

	\end{itemize}

\section{Our approach}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Our approach}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item We are going to start from the bottom up
	\item Hopefully, you have already learned about the role of sound in language
	\item We are now going to use this knowledge to start building words with letters, phrases with words, and different kinds of sentences with phrases. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Outline}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What is language?
	\item Structure in sound (Phonology)
	\item Strucutre in words (Morphology)
	\item structure in phrases (Syntax)
	\item Strucutre in sentences (More syntax)
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What about meaning?}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item You might be wondering where meaning comes in to everything
	\item Without meaning, communication would be difficult
	\item At each level, we will look at how meaning comes in to the system
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Some preliminaries}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Language is in the brain
	\item Although languages differ, they share many similarities in structure
	\item We are primarily interested in where they are similar

	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
